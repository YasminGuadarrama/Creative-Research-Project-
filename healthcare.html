	<h1> Health Care System Performance Rankings: </h1>
	<h2> The next three countries in the ranking — the U.K., Germany, and New Zealand — perform very similarly to one another (Exhibit 2). The U.S. ranks #11 — last. Exhibit 2 shows the extent to which the U.S. is an outlier: its performance falls well below the average of the other countries and far below the two countries ranked directly above it, Switzerland and Canada. In fact, the U.S. is such an outlier that we have calculated the average performance based on the other 10 countries, excluding the U.S. (see How We Measured Performance). The U.S. is last on all domains of performance except care process, on which it ranks #2. </h2>

	<h2> Access to Care: Universal, <a href = "income.html" > Affordable Coverage </a> Is Paramount</h2>
	<p> Overall, the U.S. is #11 — last — on access to care (Exhibit 1). The U.S. has the poorest performance on the <a href = "expensive.html" >affordability subdomain</a>, scoring much lower than even the next-lowest country, Switzerland (Exhibit 5). Compared to residents of the U.S., residents of the Netherlands, the U.K., Norway, and Germany are much less likely to report that their insurance denied payment of a claim or paid less than expected. Residents of these countries are also less likely to report difficulty in paying <a href = "debt.html" >medical bills</a></p>
