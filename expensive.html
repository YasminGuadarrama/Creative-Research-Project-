<p> The U.S. remains the only <a href = "income.html" >high-income</a> country lacking universal health insurance coverage. With nearly 30 million people still uninsured and some 40 million with health plans that leave them potentially underinsured, out-of-pocket health care costs continue to mar U.S. health care performance. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> The U.S. continues to outspend other nations on <a href = "healthcare.html" >health care</a>, devoting nearly twice as much of its GDP as the average OECD country. U.S. health spending reached nearly 17 percent of GDP in 2019, far above the 10 other countries compared in this report. Moreover, high U.S. <a href = "debt.html" >out-of-pocket health spending</a> per person, the second-highest in the OECD, makes it difficult for many Americans to access needed care. </p>
