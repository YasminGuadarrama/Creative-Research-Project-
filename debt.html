	<h2> Health Care Outcomes: Many Countries Achieve Better Outcomes Despite Lower Spending </h2>
	<p> </p>
	<p> U.S. doctors are the most likely to have trouble getting their patients medication or treatment because of restrictions on insurance coverage. Compared to most of the other countries, larger percentages of adults in the U.S. say they spend a lot of time on paperwork related to medical bills. For nonemergency care, U.S. and Canadian adults are also more likely to visit the emergency department â€” a less efficient option than seeing a regular doctor.</p>

	<p> the U.S. consistently demonstrated the largest disparities between income groups, except for those measures related to preventive services and safety of care. U.S. disparities are especially large when looking at financial barriers to accessing medical and dental care, <a href = "healthcare.html" >medical bill burdens</a>, difficulty obtaining after-hours care, and use of web portals to facilitate patient engagement. Compared to the other countries, the United States and Canada had larger <a href = "income.html" > income-related inequities </a> in patient reported experiences. </p>
